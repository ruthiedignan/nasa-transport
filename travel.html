      <p> Based on our research and data, a sustainable plan to reopen commercial travel involves a cut on carbon dioxide emissions from the aviation and surface travel industry. Due to the uncertainty of the future of this virus, we can project that if there is an increase in demand for aviation and surface travel, then  there will be an increase in harmful emissions and therefore an increase in global, seasonal temperatures. The demand for commercial flights has decreased dramatically when compared to foot travel, but is now gradually increasing. We predict that the global airline and cruise industry will take the greatest hit financially if the COVID-19 pandemic is not contained. Refer to our data analysis below for further information. </p>

      The graph above showcases a direct correlation between total daily flight departures around the world to heightened Covid-19 cases. This includes in-person flights as well as commercial flights. If travel restrictions were to be enforced, cases would go down but at the price of the airline industry suffering. If a sustainable plan was to be implemented, the airline industry would need to be taken into consideration.

    <section class = "conclusion">

      <p> As fewer and fewer people opt to travel on commercial flights, foot traffic(as this phenomenon is commonly called) severely declined. However, air traffic is higher, as seen in the previous graph. This is due to the recent US stimulus bill requiring airlines to keep flying their planes as usual, meaning a lot of empty flights. But as the previous graph shows as well, increased departures lead to increased Covid-19 cases no matter what. This is a very tough situation for airlines as they need to make money while at the same time not spread any more instances of the virus. </p>

      <p> Coronavirus cases are going up because people are choosing other methods of travel like road trips. Beaches like Corpus Christi in Texas and those in Florida had a huge surge of cases due to people choosing other mediums of transport. </p>

      <p> This is a graph of the Trips 100-250 miles per day. As shown in the graph, this sort of travel peaked at around March 2020, going down, and then going up again as stay at home restrictions decrease. Since foot traffic is proven to be going down, then individuals must be traveling through other possible means. When the frequency was changed to “monthly”, the overall trend in the data is an increasing slope. </p>

    <p> The graphs above display data collected from PALSAR-2 which is L-band SAR mounted on JAXA's ALOS-2 and C-band SAR mounted on European Sentinel-1. This data indicates that the number of airplanes at parking areas in the Tokyo International Airport has significantly increased due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This data is displayed in the satellite image below the graph, as it exhibits each colored pixel as a parked airplane: red was taken in November 2019, green was taken in March 2020, and blue was taken in May 2020. It is evident that there are more blue pixels in this satellite image, so we can determine that the demand for air travel in Tokyo has decreased during the pandemic into the month of May. </p>

      <p> According to this graph, from January to June 2020, CO2 emissions have gone down in the fields of public, industry, surface transport, and aviation. It is going up past April again as restrictions are going down. There was a very high CO2 effect in the past and it would not be sustainable to go back to past practices. </p>

      <p> The graph shows that there is indeed a cycle in temperature but has only gotten an increase since the 1880s and will only get worse if our methods are not changed.  </p>
