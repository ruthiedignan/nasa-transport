    <section class = "conclusion">


      <p> Based on our research and data, supply chains rely on mobility in order to function. Different forms of mobility have been impacted in various ways. For instance, park and residential mobility have both shown positive trends since the start of lockdowns worldwide. However, other forms of mobility, such as grocery, retail, and workplace displayed negative trends, but are beginning to rise to where they were before the pandemic. </p> 


      <p> However, public transit is still well-below its baseline level and the future of public transportation seems grim. Many around the world fear such a mode of transportation because they lack trust in the sanitization of such transport and believe the risk of contracting the virus may be higher in public transit. As a result, many consumers are switching to more private modes of transportation. Many cities around the world have created miles of bicycle lanes to promote private transport, ensuring the safety of their citizens. Public transit agencies will have to develop trust between their passengers and make them feel safe if they hope to return to normal operations. Although public transit mobility is increasing back towards its pre-pandemic levels (an over 40% decrease in use in late March to just a 17.6% decrease from pre-COVID), other research suggests that it may not fully return back to baseline levels of use. Ultimately, this will depend on what governments and public transit agencies do in the future. </p> 


      <p> We project mobility trends worldwide to go back to the levels they were at before the pandemic if mandatory lockdowns are not enforced. Refer to our data analysis below for further information. </p>

      <p> The graph above displays mobility trends from Waze data taken from several countries. Italy demonstrated the greatest decline in mobility, but now adopted a positive trend. It can be taken from this data, therefore, that the greatest decline in mobility trends will relatively demonstrate a greater increase in mobility after lockdown periods. Mobility in other countries have failed to cope with the demands of this pandemic since they still remain under the baseline. </p> 


      <iframe id="igraph" scrolling="no" style="border:none;" seamless="seamless" src="https://plotly.com/~amotiani22/1.embed" height="525" width="100%"></iframe>

      <p> The graph above displays mobility trends in the United States from Google Data. Until April, there have been declines in all areas other than residential mobility. Park mobility trends have increased exponentially after April, as compared to all other areas. For other forms of mobility to increase, social distancing measures must be taken into account. However, even with social distancing enforced, other areas of mobility may only be able to increase back to the baseline due to the uncertainty that encompasses the future of this pandemic. </p> 

       <iframe id="igraph" scrolling="no" style="border:none;" seamless="seamless" src="https://plotly.com/~amotiani22/5.embed" height="525" width="100%"></iframe>

      <p> The graph above displays mobility trends in the United States from Apple Maps data. Public transit usage has decreased the most, when compared to driving and walking. During the month of April, preferences for driving and walking increased, causing the mobility trends for these two areas to remain where they were before pandemic lockdowns. However, public transit still lags behind. We project that public transit, especially in urban areas, will take more time to go back to its baseline level as shown before lockdowns were placed throughout the United States. </p>

      <p class = "para">

      <b>  Means: <br>

Group 1: -0.239% <br>
Group 2: -41.3% <br>
Group 3: -41.8% <br>
Group 4: -32.9% <br>
Group 5: -30.8% </b>

<br>

After the great decline in travel with the onset of COVID-19 in the US, the workplace mobility is gradually increasing again despite the recent spikes. Because Google mobility also includes mobility changes for other places, this method can easily be applied to those types to get a full understanding of where the people are going as the pandemic progresses and what that means for the future.
<br> 
<br>
<i> What this shows: </i> After the initial decline in travel with the onset of COVID-19 in the US, workplace mobility is slowly yet steadily returning to the baseline despite the cases spiking right now. This could be interpreted as a sign of what the near future will look like. From a trough of a 41.8% decrease in workplace mobility, it has climbed back to just a 30.8% decrease from the baseline. </p> 


      <p class = "para"> 

<b>
 Means: <br>

Group 1: 5.55% <br>
Group 2: -39.8% <br>
Group 3: -33.6% <br>
Group 4: -20.3% <br>
Group 5: -13.4% </b>

<br> 

Again, the onset of COVID-19 in the US greatly decreased mobility from the baseline, with the trough being a 39.8% decrease in mobility from the baseline. However, that is now up to just a 13.4% decrease despite cases spiking, indicating that mobility is returning to what it once was. </p> 


      <p class = "para">  


       <b> Means: <br>

Group 1: 6.32%  <br>
Group 2: -10.5% <br>
Group 3: -8.5% <br>
Group 4: -1.33% <br> 
Group 5: 0.715% </b>

<br> 

Although there are still significant differences between the average changes in mobility from the baseline here, it is not as high due to the essential nature of going grocery shopping or to the pharmacy. Therefore, we donâ€™t see too much of a change from pre-COVID.

As COVID-19 becomes more of an issue, park-related activities such as hiking become better and better pastimes. This is evidenced in the significant increase in park mobility from the baseline.

<br>
<br>
Public transit use decreased by over 40% on average globally in March/early April, but that is up to just a 17.6% decrease from the pre-pandemic levels as of July.
 </p>
   <p class = "para1"> 

     <b> Means: <br>

<br>
<br>

Although public transit use has decreased significantly after COVID-19 was declared a national emergency, it is slowly returning back to normal over time.

   </p>
   <p class = "para1">

     Means: <b> <br>

Group 1: 0.197% <br>

<br>

As people generally stay at home more due to COVID-19, mobility relating to residential areas increases slightly to support that. However, with more people returning to their workplaces, using public transit, and going to places of retail and recreation (see above), we see this increase in residential mobility start decreasing back to the baseline.

 <p class = "halfn" > In the two graphs above, it is evident that public transit usage has drastically decreased around the world due to the coronavirus pandemic. While public transit usage in the United States has decreased from a range of 21.8% to 55.3%, the worldwide range is much larger - about 25.8% to 84.3%. Therefore, mobility in urban areas has decreased in the United States from January to the end of March, but not as significantly as that around the world. </p>

 <p class = "halfn" > The two NASA satellite images above clearly display the change in human activity before and during the COVID-19 pandemic in the Jianghan District in China. The use of lights display when and if roads were being used for mobility during lockdowns in China. These images may be reflective of how other regions across the globe are responding to the COVID-19 pandemic. We can utilize these images to predict in other regions that general mobility will decrease with an initial rise of COVID-19 cases. We cannot, however, predict whether mobility will decrease after several surges of cases in other regions, as they are other variables which may prevent us from coming to this conclusion.
