      <p>Based on our research and data, switching between different commerce mediums during a national emergency like the COVID-19 pandemic may negatively impact the supply chain. Spending frequency for all income levels decreases dramatically, with purchase sizes increasing for necessities, such as food, but decreasing for all other areas which may include entertainment, transportation, food services, etc. Although general spending in all areas is now beginning to increase, the supply chain was negatively impacted during this national emergency, with an exception for that of necessities. </p>

      <p> Many consumers around the world are starting to save their money rather than spend it to make sure that they are financially prepared in case another similar event occurs. We predict that the impact on the global economy may depend on consumer bias in future national and international emergencies. Refer to our data analysis below for further information. </p>

  <p>The graph above displays the US change in spending in different areas since January until the middle of July. Once lockdowns were placed in the majority of the country, spending surged for grocery and food, but plummeted for all other areas. Disregarding the spending of groceries and food, there was an inverse relationship in spending and COVID-19 cases per 100,000 until the start of April. Now, as new COVID-19 cases per 1000 increases, spending for all areas other than grocery and food is generally increasing, demonstrating a direct relationship. While the use of different commerce mediums may depend based on the areas they specialize in, it can be inferred that commerce on average will increase back to the baseline and remain there.</p>

  <p>The graph above displays the US change in spending in different income levels since January until the middle of July. Once lockdowns were placed in the majority of the country, spending plummeted on average for the three income levels. Spending by high income individuals decreased the most, followed by middle income and then low income. It can be inferred that high income classes During this time, there was an inverse relationship in spending and COVID-19 cases per 100,000 until the start of April. Now, as new COVID-19 cases per 100,000 increases, spending based on each income level has increased. While the use of different commerce mediums may depend based on each individualâ€™s preference, it can be inferred that commerce on average will increase back to the baseline and remain there.</p>

<section class = "conclusion">

  <p>The graph above shows the dynamics of U.S. shopping behavior before, during, and after national lockdown. Because the trend of the purchase size contradicts the trend of shopper penetration, this negatively impacts supply chain; consumers are purchasing larger quantities of products than average, but because the shopper penetration rate is steady, this implies that consumers are buying more than what was once considered necessary, ultimately depleting stocks of goods at a much quicker rate. This alters the prices of goods, mostly by raising prices, as well as forcefully speeding up the production rate, creating an accordion effect in the supply chain.</p>
