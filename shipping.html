      <p> The pandemic brought the worldwide economy and supply chain to its knees, revealing its inherent faults. Much of the world relies on Chinese labor exports and when the pandemic hit, the supply chain was heavily disrupted. Many factories had to shut down, delaying manufacturing for systems around the world. The masks that the United States desperately needed were on the other side of the world. The pandemic exposed the dependability of many nations around the world on Chinese/foreign goods.</p>

      <p> Based on our research and data analysis, the worldwide prices of commodities have decreased due to the shipping sector’s loss of supply from the COVID-19 pandemic. We have determined that it may be in the best interest economically for companies to choose to produce domestically and to discontinue outsourcing of labor, with disregard to any confounding variables, since there is still uncertainty regarding the future of this pandemic. As the pandemic has shown, global shipping can be brought to a standstill in case an event like this occurs again. Nations and companies must have resources available domestically in order to prevent economic downfall. </p>

  <p>The graph above estimates the recovery rate of each commodity category post COVID-19. This could be useful information for our examination post COVID-19 because it is a projection of recovery for the impacts that the supply chain endured; an especially vulnerable commodity category is the “Automotive and Transportation” section, which is critical to understand when forecasting COVID’s impacts on one of our subtopics that revolves around transportation.</p>

  <p> The two graphs above show the drastic decrease in demand for foreign overseas shipping during the initial stages of the coronavirus pandemic in China. Caixin China PMI, a Chinese company in the maritime sector, experienced a loss in exports during 2009 followed by a speedy recovery, as shown in the graph on the left. An initial decrease in exports was expected due to the Chinese New Year, however, the coronavirus outbreak caused a downfall for crude tanker demand. Since crude tanker demand is relative to that of other commodities which can be produced domestically, American companies that relied on the chinese maritime sector may need to come to a decision on whether it is more economically efficient to discontinue foreign trade during this pandemic.</p>

  <p> The four graphs above display trade activity in the U.S.-Canada border crossings, in active Canadian airports, in active American airports, and in U.S. and Canadian ports, respectively. In the first graph, there is a gradual decrease in truck volume leading up to early July with average border crossing duration remaining the same. However, truck volume has gradually increased since April; this indicates that, although truck volume may continue to fluctuate, ground shipping will not experience a dramatic decrease unless there are restrictions at border crossings. In the second and third graphs, there is a sharp decrease from March 15 followed by a gradual increase since April until now, during July ; this also indicates that air shipping will not experience a dramatic decrease unless restrictions are placed at airports. In the fourth graph, there is a higher level of variability with port activity now, during July, than there was around the start of the pandemic, during March. However, disregarding the sharp increase in port activity in mid-April, activity to and from sea ports has not shown a general trend, so there may not be a detrimental impact to foreign trade in the maritime shipping sector with restrictions placed. Ground shipping and air shipping volumes have shown decreases when restrictions were placed due to COVID-19, while sea shipping volumes have not demonstrated any general trend. Based on this data, it may be in the best interest for a company to be involved in sea shipping or to produce domestically with the uncertainty that constitutes the future of this pandemic. </p>

  <p>These images display high definition nightlights as captured by the Suomi satellite on the first day of each month, from January until June 2020, at the Port of Ghent, Belgium. When placed side-by-side, it may be unrecognizable, however, there is a decrease in nightlights until April. After April, nightlights are more present at the Port of Ghent, which relates to data that demonstrates that port activity has increased after lockdowns were lifted worldwide. </p>

  <p> The first two graphs above display port activity at the Port of Ghent (in Belgium) using satellite data from NASA/ESA/JAXA. Both graphs demonstrate the demand for commodities (metals and nonmetals) at the Port of Ghent from the beginning of January until the end of June. These graphs indicate that the demand for commodities has decreased during lockdowns in March, and then remained below the reference line. The decrease in port activity indicates the decrease in demand for commodities, as shown in the third graph, with crude’s demand plummeting below 60%. Disregarding all other variables, the worldwide prices of commodities have therefore dramatically decreased and it may be more efficient to discontinue foreign trade as a result of this. </p>

  <p> The three graphs above display NASA/JAXA/ESA data which displays shipping activity at major ports in the United States (San Francisco, Los Angeles, and New York City). San Francisco and New York City ports had a significant decrease in activity during the beginning of March, whereas the Los Angeles port experienced its greatest number of ships, as shown on March 8, 2020. However, after this date, the Los Angeles port activity decreased and remained near the baseline, which is similar to the San Francisco port activity. The New York City port, however, increased in activity near the end of March. This data signifies that port activity is not consistent during this pandemic, and that the supply chain may be disrupted in the future if further restrictions are placed on cargo ships. </p>
