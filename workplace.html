      <p> This pandemic has shown that employees do not have to be physically present at the workplace to perform their work. Platforms like Zoom, Google Meets, WebEx, etc, have replaced the traditional workplace. Many are able to work from home and keep the same productivity levels. Is this the future of the workplace? Virtual meetings, presentations, webinars, etc. In an age where technology has enabled us to do so much, is a physical workplace even required? </p>

      <p> The answer is “it depends.” While it is true that many people can and will continue to work virtually, some things just aren’t possible to do over a Zoom meeting. For example, blue-collar jobs require some form of physical labor and presence, and the lockdown imposed in many countries around the world, especially the United States, have led to the vast amount of unemployment rates in this area. However, many blue-collar workers are beginning to return to the workplace as unemployment levels are slowly decreasing from their spike in May of 2020, resulting in an increase of workplace transit. </p>

      <p> However, the story is different for white-collar workers. In order to facilitate face-to-face interactions, many companies have opened satellite offices in locations around the world, reducing the need for extensive travel by employees. At the same time, the virtual workplace has become a reliable alternative to a physical office. The combination of these two developments have resulted in reduced travel by white-collar employees. </p>

      <p> So what does this mean? <b> Workplace mobility will continue to rise as blue-collar workers return to their jobs, but will not reach pre-COVID levels as many still continue to work from home or in nearby satellite offices. </b> </p>

      <p>This visual above displays the drastic increase in total unemployment claims by state from January until the middle of spring followed by a gradual decrease until the end of June. Due to the coronavirus pandemic, companies have not been able to produce at profitable levels. Therefore, regarding the uncertainty of the future of this pandemic, it may be in the best interest for companies to choose to have employees work from home if possible. In terms of transport, this may indicate a miniscule decrease in domestic mobility, since a small percentage of Americans may not have to choose to drive to and from work. </p>

      <p> The graph above shows the suitability for a workplace to become remote by broad categories of career paths. Although this data was not collected through a scientific process, rather through surveying users of a workplace communication platform, this could be helpful in predicting the workplaces that have the potential to pursue sustainable practices after COVID-19 and continue remote working, ultimately lowering the CO2 emissions that result in individual travel to work. </p>
