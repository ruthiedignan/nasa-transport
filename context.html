 <section class = "about"> 

   <p> Before the coronavirus pandemic, there was not significant uncertainty regarding the future of the economy. Sectors including shipping, travel, and shopping now face an unprecedented future. As a result, the workplace and general mobility trends worldwide have drastically changed. It is our goal to predict answers to these five guiding questions regarding the future of the coronavirus pandemic: </p> 

   <ul> 

     <li> How will switching between different commerce mediums (i.e. physical, online) impact the economy during national emergencies and after? </li>
     <li> What will the future of the workplace (in terms of transport) look like after the pandemic? </li>
     <li> Why have supply chains and different forms of mobility failed to cope with the demands of this pandemic? </li>
     <li> How have the worldwide prices of commodities been affected by the shipping sectorâ€™s impact from the COVID-19 pandemic and is it more efficient to produce domestically or to continue foreign trade </li>
     <li> What is a sustainable plan to reopen commercial travel and which industries do we project to take the greatest hit financially due to the COVID-19 pandemic? </li>





   </ul>
